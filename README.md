## 🧠 Who am I (besides tired)?

Hey there! I’m **Neku**, a developer powered by coffee, chaos and an infinite loop of refactoring.  
I'm the founder of **Akira Studios** (we build cool stuff™) and the proud architect behind **AtenaMC**, a Minecraft server where every plugin has trust issues… because I wrote them all from scratch.  
Yes, even the config loader. Yes, it supports MiniMessage. Yes, it was a life choice.

## 💾 Tech Stack (a.k.a. the languages I yell at)

| Language | Relationship Status |
|----------|----------------------|
| ☕ Java   | Long-term commitment. We argue a lot, but I always come back. |
| 🐍 Python | Therapy language. For when Java breaks my heart. |
| 💀 C*     | “Just one pointer, what could go wrong?” – me, before the crash. |

> 💬 Currently learning how to summon segfaults with style.

## 🏗️ What I Actually Build

- Minecraft server systems (custom, crazy and cursed™)
- Discord bots that do more than just `/ping`
- Configurable, scalable, and localized (yes, even Klingon) software
- Clean code... after five commits and a breakdown

## 🛠️ Projects

| Project    | Description                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Akira Studios** | Where I experiment with AI, bots, and systems that should probably be illegal |
| **AtenaMC**       | A Minecraft server with way too much backend logic and zero Spigot plugins from 2016 |
