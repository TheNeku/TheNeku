# 👋 Yo! I'm Neku

Hey there! I’m a developer powered by coffee, chaos and an infinite loop of refactoring.  
I'm the founder of **Akira Studios** (we build cool stuff™) and the proud architect behind **McMaster**, a Minecraft server where every plugin has trust issues… because I wrote them all from scratch.  
Yes, even the config loader. Yes, it supports MiniMessage. Yes, it was a life choice.

## 🧠 Who I Am (besides a dev with 100+ Projects open and 2 completed)

- ☕ Java loyalist (we’ve had our ups and `NullPointerExceptions`, but we’re working through it)
- 🐍 Python enthusiast (clean, readable, and doesn't yell at me — usually)
- 🧠 Currently exploring C++ (because I heard debugging segfaults builds character)
- Builder of systems that sometimes work on the first try — and always have a config file

---

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🔧 Custom plugins and software (with a slight obsession for clean architecture)
- 🧙 Discord bots that go beyond basic commands
- 🌐 Scalable, localized systems with actual structure™
- 🧪 Break things, fix them, and then pretend it was intentional

## ⚙️ Tech I Argue With

> Once built a whole system just to avoid using Essentials. Zero regrets.

## 🎯 Goals

- Write code that doesn’t scare future me
- Actually understand C pointers without existential dread
- Make dev tools that feel like cheating (but legal)
- Keep learning, building, and occasionally yelling at compilers
